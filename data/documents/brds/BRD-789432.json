  "title": "Age-Based Video Popularity Discovery Mobile Application",
  "executive_summary": "This document outlines the business requirements for developing a mobile application that provides users with insights into the most popular videos watched by different age groups. The app will aggregate viewing data across multiple platforms to create a comprehensive database of video content preferences segmented by viewer age, enabling users to discover trending content specific to any age demographic. This innovative solution addresses the growing need for age-appropriate content discovery and cross-generational understanding of media consumption patterns, targeting both individual users seeking content recommendations and businesses looking to understand demographic viewing trends.",
  "business_context": "The video streaming market has grown exponentially with platforms like YouTube, TikTok, Netflix, and others generating billions of hours of watch time daily. However, there's a significant gap in understanding what content resonates with different age groups. Current recommendation algorithms are personalized but don't provide broader demographic insights. Market research shows 73% of users struggle to find age-appropriate content for family members, while 65% of marketers lack clear data on age-specific video preferences. Competitors like Google Trends and Social Blade provide general analytics but don't offer age-segmented video popularity data. This represents a $2.3B market opportunity in the content discovery and analytics space.",
  "problem_statement": "Users currently lack a centralized platform to discover what videos are trending among specific age groups, making it difficult to understand generational content preferences, find age-appropriate content for different family members, or identify cross-generational viewing patterns for content creation and marketing purposes.",
