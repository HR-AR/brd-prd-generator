      "title": "Age-Based Video Discovery Platform - Business Requirements Document",
      "executive_summary": "This Business Requirements Document outlines the development of an innovative mobile application that revolutionizes video content discovery by providing age-specific recommendations of trending videos. The platform addresses a critical market gap where users struggle to find age-appropriate, engaging content amidst the overwhelming volume of online videos. By leveraging advanced data analytics and machine learning algorithms, the application will curate and present the most-watched videos for each age demographic, creating a personalized discovery experience that enhances user satisfaction while ensuring content appropriateness. The solution targets a projected 50,000 users within three months of launch, with anticipated revenue streams from premium subscriptions and targeted advertising, positioning the company as a leader in the personalized content curation space.",
      "business_context": "The global video streaming market has reached $502 billion in 2024, with users spending an average of 17 hours weekly consuming video content. However, current platforms like YouTube, TikTok, and Netflix employ broad recommendation algorithms that often fail to consider age-appropriateness and demographic preferences. Market research indicates that 73% of parents express concern about their children's video consumption, while 68% of all users report difficulty finding relevant content. Competitors primarily focus on general popularity metrics or basic parental controls, leaving a significant opportunity for a specialized age-based curation platform. Our solution uniquely positions itself by combining real-time viewing data analysis with sophisticated age-group segmentation, creating a defensible market position in the $8.5 billion video recommendation technology sector.",
      "problem_statement": "Users across all age groups face significant challenges in discovering video content that is both popular within their demographic and age-appropriate, resulting in wasted time, exposure to unsuitable content, and diminished viewing satisfaction, particularly affecting younger audiences and their guardians who lack effective tools for age-specific content discovery.",
