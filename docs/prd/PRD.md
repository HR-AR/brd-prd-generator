# Product Requirement Document (PRD)

## Idea
Build a production-ready BRD/PRD generation system that automatically converts unstructured business ideas into structured Business Requirement Documents (BRDs) and Product Requirement Documents (PRDs) using multiple LLM providers (ChatGPT-5, Claude 4.1 Opus, Gemini 2.5 Pro). The system provides cost tracking, quality validation, and exports documents in multiple formats.

## Why
- **KPI impact**:
  - Reduce document creation time from 2-3 weeks to < 2 minutes
  - Improve requirement quality with automated SMART criteria validation
  - Reduce rework cycles by ensuring BRD-PRD traceability
  - Lower costs through intelligent LLM provider selection and caching
- **User/Process**:
  - Product Managers: Quickly formalize ideas into standardized documents
  - Engineering Teams: Get clear, validated requirements reducing ambiguity
  - Stakeholders: Faster approval cycles with consistent formatting
  - Process: Fits at project inception phase, before development kickoff
- **Constraints**:
  - Stack: Python 3.11+, FastAPI, Pydantic, multi-LLM support
  - Performance: BRD < 45s, PRD < 60s generation time
  - Cost: < $2.00 per document pair generation
  - API providers: Must support ChatGPT-5, Claude 4.1 Opus, Gemini 2.5 Pro
  - Scalability: Handle 50+ concurrent requests
  - Security: OWASP top 10 compliance, secure API key storage

## Non-Goals
- Visual wireframe/mockup generation (text-based only)
- Project management workflow integration (export only)
- Real-time collaborative editing (single-user generation)
- Natural language querying of existing documents
- Automatic code generation from PRDs
- Multi-language support in initial version (English only)
- On-premise deployment (cloud-first architecture)
